### Qucik Start

Our classroom is situated in Bamako, capital city of Mali in the West of Africa. Bamako comes 
from a Bambara (local language in Mali) word meaning "crocodile tail". It is the capital city 
of African music and the city of "Diatiguiya" or hospitality. The Empire of Mali was home to 
the great Sundiata Keita.

DELGEME is a multidisciplinary team dedicated to Malaria Research. The team has expertise in 
many areas of Biomedical research with collaborators from USA, Europe, and Africa. The team 
trains students from many African countries mainly in Bioinformatics. The main goal at DELGEME 
is to fill the gap in African research by training young African scientists in "big data" analyses.

The major areas of research include: Malaria epidemiology, Molecular epidemiology, Drug resistance, 
malaria vector biology, Human Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, Epigenetics, Biostatistics, 
Clinical trials

### The Classroom
---
The classroom is made up of five training assistants (TAs) plus the node principal investigator (PI).

There are about 15 participants with a diverse repertoire of backgroungs; Molecular Biology, 
Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Mathematics, Medicine, Pharmacy, Medical Laboratory Technology, 
Biomedical Science, Clinical Biology
