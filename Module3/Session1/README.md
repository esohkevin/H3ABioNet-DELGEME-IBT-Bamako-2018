## Overview
-----
* __Sequence alignment__ is a way of arranging two or more sequences
(DNA, RNA, or A.a.(proteins)) to identify regions of similar character
patterns.

* Sequence similarity could be a result of __functional__, __structural__, or
__evolutionary__ relationships between the sequences.

### Sequence Similarity Vs Identity
- __- Sequence Identity:__ Exactly the same Amino acid or nucleotide in the same position.

- __- Sequence Similarity:__ Content includes substitutions (A.a residues) with similar chemical properties.

- __- Similarity:__ A quantifiable property- Two sequences are similar if order of sequence 
characters is recognizably the same and they can be aligned.

- __- Orthologous sequences:__ quite similar sequences found in different species 
(i.e. due to a speciation event), and carrying out a similar biological function.

- __- Paralogous sequences:__ Sequences related through gene duplication events. Can 
have variable biological function within a species.
